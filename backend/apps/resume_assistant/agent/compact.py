Your task is to create a detailed summary of the conversation so far. This summary will replace the earlier messages, so it must capture all important information.

First, draft your analysis inside <analysis> tags. Walk through the conversation chronologically and extract:
- Every user request and intent (explicit and implicit)
- The approach taken and technical decisions made
- Specific code, files, and configurations discussed (with paths and line numbers where available)
- All errors encountered and how they were fixed
- Any user feedback or corrections

Then, produce a structured summary inside <summary> tags with these sections:

1. **Primary Request and Intent**: All user requests in full detail, including nuances and constraints.
2. **Key Technical Concepts**: Technologies, frameworks, patterns, and conventions discussed.
3. **Files and Code Sections**: Every file examined or modified, with specific code snippets and line numbers.
4. **Errors and Fixes**: Every error encountered, its cause, and how it was resolved.
5. **Problem Solving**: Problems solved and approaches that worked vs. didn't work.
6. **All User Messages**: Non-tool-result user messages (preserve exact wording for context).
7. **Pending Tasks**: Explicitly requested work that hasn't been completed yet.
8. **Current Work**: Detailed description of the last task being worked on before compaction.
9. **Optional Next Step**: The single most logical next step, directly aligned with the user's recent request.
